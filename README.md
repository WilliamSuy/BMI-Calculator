BMI Calculator Codes

These are the programs that were made by myself for a BMI Calculator.
All code are created by me only, unless specified.
They may be messy to read, but that is because I am a beginner, but feel free to reach out to me for clarification.
There are a few different files, here are the explanations for each.


BMIWilliamSuy: This is the first BMI program made as a project for CSC210, and recieved full marks.

BMICalculator: This is a free lance project done off of the BMI Project to prompt the user in choosing between the imperial or metric scale in order to calculate the BMI whether it's Imperial or Metric scale.

BMI Pro Trial: This is a project in which I experimented with the do while and for loops in order to produce an array of info for a second BMI project. Both do while and for loops work just the same, and either can be used for the final product.

BMI02WilliamSuy: This is the second BMI project in which combines the standard and the pro version in the first prompt of the code. It is a mashup of the BMIWilliamSuy and BMI Pro Trial in one java file.
